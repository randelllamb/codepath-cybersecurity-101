# CodePath Cybersecurity 101 – Security Labs & Portfolio

This repository showcases my hands-on work from the CodePath Cybersecurity 101 course. The program introduces offensive and defensive security fundamentals through real-world style labs, CTF challenges, and guided security exercises. The work here reflects foundational skills used by security analysts, penetration testers, and incident response teams.

## 🔐 Course Overview
CodePath Cybersecurity 101 covers the following technical concepts:

- Linux security & permissions  
- Hashing, password cracking, and authentication weaknesses  
- Web security fundamentals (XSS, SQL Injection)  
- Network traffic analysis using Wireshark  
- Basic malware and file system forensics  
- Practical exploitation techniques  
- Capture-the-Flag (CTF) problem-solving

## 🧪 Labs Included

### **Lab 1 — Linux & Shell Security**
- Explored file permissions, privilege escalation risks, and system hardening.  
- Learned secure command-line operations and environment protections.

### **Lab 2 — Hashing & Password Cracking**
- Identified hash formats and executed brute-force / dictionary attacks.  
- Used password auditing tools to analyze entropy and weaknesses.

### **Lab 3 — Web Security Basics**
- Performed simulated SQL injection vulnerability tests.  
- Created proof-of-concept XSS payloads in a controlled environment.  
- Practiced secure input validation patterns.

### **Lab 4 — Network Traffic Analysis**
- Analyzed packet captures (PCAPs) for suspicious activity.  
- Identified attack signatures and abnormal traffic behavior.  
- Investigated compromised session traffic.

### **Lab 5 — Incident Response & Forensics**
- Examined logs and filesystem artifacts from a simulated breach.  
- Documented findings using incident reporting standards.  

### **Final Challenge — Capture the Flag (CTF)**
- Multi-step challenge involving reconnaissance, exploitation, and analysis.  
- Demonstrated problem-solving across authentication, web, and network layers.
